# Matrix

**Matrix Data Structure** is a **two-dimensional** array that consists of rows and columns. It is an arrangement of elements in horizontal or vertical lines of entries. It is also considered as an array of arrays, where array at each index has the same size.

## Applications

- In Algorithms: Matrix are frequently used in problems based on **Dynamic Programming Algorithm** to store the answer to already computed states.
- Image processing: Images can be represented as a matrix of pixels, where each pixel corresponds to an element in the matrix. This helps in preforming different operations on images.
- Transportation and logistics: Matrices are used in transportation and logistics to represent transportation networks and to solve optimization problems such as the transportation problem and the assignment problem.
- Finance: Matrices are used in finance to represent portfolios of assets, to calculate the risk and return of investments, and to perform operations such as asset allocation and optimization.
