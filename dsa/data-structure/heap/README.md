# Heap Data Structure

A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

## Types of Heap data structure

- Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be the greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
- Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
