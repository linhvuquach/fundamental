# Hash Data Structure

A Hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a special function called a hash function. Hash stores the data in an associative manner in an array where each data value has its own unique index.

Hash tables are generally using arrays and the performance of hashing data structure depends upon these three factors:

- Hash function
- Size of the Hash Table
- Collision handling method
