# Graph Data Structure

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. More formally a Graph can be defined as, A Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.

## Types of Graphs

Based on the direction of edges, there are two types of graphs:

- Undirectecd Graph: A graph in which all the edges are bi-directional and the edges are not directed in any specific direction to vertices.
- Directed Graph: A graph in which all the edges are uni-directional and the edges are directed to some specific vertex.

Based on the weith of edges, there are two types of graphs:

- Weighted Graph: A graph in which every edge has a value or weight and the values can represent quantities such as cost, distance, and time.
- Unweighted Graph: A graph in which there is no value or weight associated with the edge. All the graphs are said to be unweighted by default unless there is a value associated.
