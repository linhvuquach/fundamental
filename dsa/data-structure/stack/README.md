# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion are done at one end this end is generally called the top. It works on the principle of **Last In First Out (LIFO)** or First in Last out (FILO). LIFO means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first. FILO means, the last inserted element is available first and is the first one to be deleted.
