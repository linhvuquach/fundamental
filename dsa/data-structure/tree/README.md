# Tree

A tree is **non-linear** and a **hierarchical data structure** consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”).

Depth and height are properties of a Node:

- **The depth** of a Node is the number of edges from the Node to the Tree's root Node
- **The height** of a Node is the number of edges on the longest path from the Node to a Leaf Node.
