# B-Tree

The limitations of traditional binary search trees can be frustrating. Meet the B-Tree, the multi-talented data structure that can **handle massive amounts of data** with ease. When it comes to storing and searching large amounts of data, traditional binary search trees can become impractical due to their poor performance and high memory usage. B-Trees, also known as B-Tree or Balanced Tree, are a type of self-balancing tree that was specifically designed to overcome these limitations.

Unlike traditional binary search trees, **B-Trees are characterized by the large number of keys that they can store in a single node**, which is why they are also known as “large key” trees. **Each node in a B-Tree can contain multiple keys**, which allows the tree to have a larger branching factor and thus a shallower height. This shallow height leads to less disk I/O, which **results in faster search and insertion operations**. B-Trees are particularly well suited for storage systems that have slow, bulky data access such as hard drives, flash memory, and CD-ROMs.

B-Trees maintains balance by ensuring that each node has a minimum number of keys, so the tree is always balanced. This balance guarantees that the time complexity for operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching is always O(log n), regardless of the initial shape of the tree.
