# Binary Search Tree Data Structure

Binary Search Tree is a data structure used in computer science for organizing and storing data in a sorted manner. Binary search tree follows all properties of binary tree and its left child contains values less than the parent node and the right child contains values greater than the parent node. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient Searching, Insertion, and Deletion operations on the data stored in the tree.
