# Queue

A Queue is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

## Types of queues

- Simple Queue: In a simple queue, insertion takes place at the rear and removal occurs at the front. It strictly follows the FIFO (First in First out) rule.
- Circular Queue: In a circular queue, the last element points to the first element making a circular link.
- Priority Queue: In a priority queue, the nodes will have some predefined priority in the priority queue. The node with the least priority will be the first to be removed from the queue. Insertion takes place in the order of arrival of the nodes.
- Double-Ended Queue: In a double-ended queue, insertion and removal of elements can be performed from either the front or rear. So, we can say that it does not follow the FIFO (First In First Out) rule.
