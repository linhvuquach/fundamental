# Data Structure and Algorithm

## What is DSA?

Imagine you have a bunch of data you want to organize and manage efficiently, like a list of numbers or names. Data structures are like different ways of organizing and storing that data, kind of like different types of containers for your stuff. They help you perform operations on your data, like searching, sorting, or adding new items, quickly and effectively.

Algorithms, on the other hand, are step-by-step instructions or procedures for solving a specific problem. They're like recipes for accomplishing tasks with your data, such as finding the shortest route between two points, sorting a list of numbers, or searching for a particular item in a collection.

So, in simple terms, data structures are the different ways you can organize your data, and algorithms are the methods or steps you use to work with that data efficiently. They're like tools and techniques that help you manage and manipulate information effectively in computer science.

## Data Structure summary concepts

1. Array
   Array are one of the most basic data stuctures and are used to store a collection of elements in a contiguous block of memory.

2. Matrix
   A matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements, arranged in rows and columns. It's represented as a rectangular grid, with each element at the intersection of a row and column.

3. Linkedin List
   A Linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a data value and a reference to the next node in the list.

4. Stack & Queue
   Stack and Queue are data structure that are used to store a collection of elements. A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure, while a queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.
