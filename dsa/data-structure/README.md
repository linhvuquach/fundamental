# Data Structure and Algorithm

Data structures and Algorithms are dependent on each other. We use a well-suited data structure to apply algorithms.

⚠️ It's important that you start learning Data Structure first, but do not dig deep into them without the knowledge of Algorithms.

## What is DSA?

Imagine you have a bunch of data you want to organize and manage efficiently, like a list of numbers or names. Data structures are like different ways of organizing and storing that data, kind of like different types of containers for your stuff. They help you perform operations on your data, like searching, sorting, or adding new items, quickly and effectively.

Algorithms, on the other hand, are step-by-step instructions or procedures for solving a specific problem. They're like recipes for accomplishing tasks with your data, such as finding the shortest route between two points, sorting a list of numbers, or searching for a particular item in a collection.

So, in simple terms, data structures are the different ways you can organize your data, and algorithms are the methods or steps you use to work with that data efficiently. They're like tools and techniques that help you manage and manipulate information effectively in computer science.

## Data Structure summary concepts

1. Array

   Array are one of the most basic data stuctures and are used to store a collection of elements in a contiguous block of memory.

2. Matrix

   A matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements, arranged in rows and columns. It's represented as a rectangular grid, with each element at the intersection of a row and column.

3. Linkedin List

   A Linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a data value and a reference to the next node in the list.

4. Stack & Queue

   Stack and Queue are data structure that are used to store a collection of elements. A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure, while a queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.

5. Binary Tree

   Binary Tree is a hierachical data structure where each node has at most 2 child nodes, referred to as the `left` child and the `right` child. Binary trees are mostly used to represent hierachical data, such as file systems or family trees.

6. Binary Search Tree

   BST is a data strucutre used for storing data in a sorted manner. Each node in BST has at most 2 children, a `left` child and a `right` child, with the `left` child containing values less than the parent node and the `right` child containing values greater than the parent node. This hierachical structure allows for efficent searching, insertion, and deletion operations on the data stored in the tree.

7. Heap

   A Heap is a `complete Binary tree` data structure that satisfies that heap property. For every node, the value of its children is less | greater than for equal to its own value. Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.

8. Hash Table (Hashing)

   Hashing is a technique that generates a fixed-size output (hash value) from an input of variable size using mathematical formulas called `hash functions`. Hashing is used to determine an index or location for storing an item in a data structure, allowing for efficient retrieval and insertion.

9. Graph

   Graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges. Graphs are mostly used to represent networks, such as social networks or transportation networks.
