# SOLID principle

The SOLID principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They're a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.

## The single responsibility principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

## The open-closed principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying it.

## The Liskov substitution principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

## The interface segregation principle (ISP)

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. This principle suggests breaking larger interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

## The dependency inversion principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstraction. Abstractions should not depend on details, details should depend on abstraction.
