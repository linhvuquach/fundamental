# DRY principles (Don't repeat yourself)

Piece of knowledge or logic should have a single, unambiguous representation within a system.

When you violate DRY, you often find yourself with multiple pieces of code that do the same thing, which can lead to several problems:

1. Increased maintenance effort: Changes need to be made in multiple places.
2. Increased chance of bugs: If you update one instance but forget others, it leads to inconsistencies.
3. Reduced clarity: It's harder to understand the system when logic is scattered.

Benefits of DRY:

1. Easier maintenance
2. Better scalability
3. Reduced complexity
4. Improved readability
